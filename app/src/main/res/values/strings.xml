    <string name="instruction_info">FLINGER is a single player game where the aim is to hit the targets on the other side of the screen.\nThe path to the screen is blocked by
    obstacles. These obstacles will increase as you progress through the game. In addition, the target will become smaller and harder to hit. You can aim the ball by holding it down
        and trying to fling the ball at the targets.</string>

    <string name="instruction_info"> FLING your ball at the gold target to score points.
        If you miss, you lose. As you progress it will become increasingly difficult.
        \n\n There are several obstacles you must consider.
        \n
        \n Red Ball: Minus 1 to your score
        \n Blue Ball: Switch the direction of your ball
        \n Pink Ball: Speeds up your ball
        \n Black Ball: Kills your ball
